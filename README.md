**Amazon meets Craigslist for local stores, built at Hack the North 2015**

Instead of browsing Amazon for your next purchase, use Losocco! Search local store inventory, save shipping costs, and support your local economy. Do it all from your phone with easy payments through PayPal and CoinBase.

Stores can now get online without competing for Google Search rankings, just compete with your local competition (like on Yelp). Save time with easy Quickbooks integration so every sale is properly recorded with your regular accounting records.
